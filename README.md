 <p>Hi everyone! My name is Boni Rosales, but I like to go by the nickname "Bo".  
        Like many of you, I am interested in developing myself personally and professionally
    within the world of web development. 
            </p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my lovely 
    girlfriend and daughter, Kimberly. I also enjoy playing video games, watching soccer and occasionally making beer!
    I also proudly say that I "try" to play Super Smash Brothers competitvely and play, Luigi, the best brother.
     </p>
         <p> Please feel free to review my portfolio and if you have any questions about my works or what I can do 
        for you and your needs, don't hesitate to contact me.
          </p>
