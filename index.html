        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Boni Rosales, but I like to go by the nickname "Bo".
           I'm very passtionate about growing myself both personally and professionally within the world of web 
           development. My main motivation for learning to code is my family. 
        </p>
        <p> I enjoy spending time with my beautiful girlfriend and daguhter in my spare time. I also enjoy watching soccer (Go Liverpool FC!),
            and playing video games. I play Super Smash Brothers semi competetively with my friends.
        </p>
        <p> Please review my portfolio, if you have questions don't hestitate to reach out to me. If you have feedback please let me know
            what I can do better. I hope to continue to grow and help anyone within the web development world as best as I can.
