        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Boni Rosales, but I like to go by the nickname "Bo".
            Like many of you, I am interested in developing myself personally and professionally
            within the world of web development.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my lovely
            girlfriend and daughter, Kimberly. I also enjoy playing video games, watching soccer and occasionally
            making beer!
            I also proudly say that I "try" to play Super Smash Brothers competitvely and play, Luigi, the best
            brother.
        </p>
        <p> Please feel free to review my portfolio and if you have any questions about my works or what I can do
            for you and your needs, don't hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
